# The ComputeServer host group contains the Compute Server that executes SAS code on behalf of the Compute Service.
# It supports more than one host during initial deployment for both single-tenant and multi-tenant deployments.
# If multiple hosts are configured, home directories must be located on shared storage devices as configured by
# the customer. Examples of shared storage are a shared directory, CAS, or other accessible location. Failover is
# not supported. In the event of a failure, a session will be established on a different host, and the user must
# log on to re-establish state. In a multi-tenant environment, hosts are shared across all tenants. Adding additional
# hosts to this host group after the initial deployment is not currently supported for multi-tenant deployments.

# The rabbitmq host group contains Rabbit MQ, a messaging broker.
# The deployment will take the first entry in this host list as the "primary"
# machine to initialize the cluster. After that deployment, if you adjust the
# inventory and place a different entry as the first Rabbit MQ machine, you will
# run the risk two distinct Rabbit MQ clusters running independently with no
# knowledge of each other and messages split between the two.

# A RabbitMQ cluster must have an odd number of machines.

# The sas_casserver_primary host group contains the CAS controller node.
# The first host in the sas_casserver_primary list is used by the tenant in a single-tenant deployment or by the
# provider in a multi-tenant deployment. Only one configuration of CAS (including one primary controller and one
# secondary controller) per tenant is supported. Therefore, if you change the first host in the list, you are
# changing the primary CAS controller for a single-tenant deployment or, for multi-tenant deployments, you
# are changing the primary CAS controller for the provider. Any additional hosts in the sas_casserver_primary
# list are used in a multi-tenant environment. The configuration for those additional hosts (primary controller,
# secondary controller, or worker) are determined by the tenant-vars.yml file.
# For more information about the tenant-vars.yml file, see the SAS Viya Administration documentation.

# The sas_casserver_secondary host group can be used to create a CAS backup controller node.
# This is an optional node that can take over for the primary CAS controller node if it fails. It is used only by
# the tenant in a single-tenant deployment or by the provider in a multi-tenant deployment. Secondary controllers
# for additional tenants are determined by the tenant-vars.yml file. To support failover for predefined libraries,
# a shared file system must be available for the primary and secondary controllers. Each CAS cluster can have only
# one CAS backup controller node.
# For more information about the shared file system, see the SAS Viya deployment documentation.

# The sas_casserver_worker host group contains CAS worker node.
# It is used only by the tenant in a single-tenant deployment or by the provider in a multi-tenant deployment. Workers
# for additional tenants are determined by the tenant-vars.yml file.
# For more information about the tenant-vars.yml file, see the SAS Viya Administration documentation.
